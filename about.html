        <h3>About Eugene Myofascial Release</h3>
<!-- make this a quote: "Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm" Ralph Waldo Emerson -->
        <p> Eugene  Myofascial Release was  founded in 2008 by  Dael Parsons, LMT,  Advanced Myofascial Release Therapist and  student of John F. Barnes, PT.  Her vision is to bring Myofascial Release into the mainstream of health-care in her community .</p>
        <p>Following a life-long interest in body/ mind/ spirit  growth and healing , Dael Parsons decided to pursue massage therapy as a career after her children were grown.   Licensed as a massage therapist in 2003, her Myofascial Release journey began through her own shoulder injury.  After being in pain for months, she received treatment - and relief- from a John Barnes trained therapist.  She began studying with John F. Barnes, PT. in the beginning of 2007.  She has been enthusiastically pursuing her education in the John F. Barnes approach to Myofascial Release directly under  John Barnes since then.  She achieved classification as and "Expert"  JFBMFR therapist in 2010.  In September of 2011 she was invited be an official member of the John Barnes team of instructors.  She brings joy, passion, and enthusiasm  to her work and continues to study, learn, and grow. </p>
