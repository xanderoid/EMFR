I would especially like to express my sincere gratitude for a group of MODX Ambassadors who have assumed the roles of lead maintainers and developers for MODX Evolution: <strong>Dmytro Lukianenko</strong> (Dmi3yy), <strong>Mansori Yamamato</strong> (yama), <strong>Thomas Jakobi</strong> (jako) and <strong>Agel_Nash</strong> (Yevgeny Borisov). With these talented and trusted individuals at the helm of MODX Evolution, your Evo sites should be sound. Not only did they do a great job of managing this release, but they also began bug marshalling the Evo Project Tracker. As a result, the Evo Project tracker should see more activity and more accurately represent the outstanding issue queue; in fact they’re already planning 1.0.10.<br />
<br />
We’d also like to thank all the individuals who took the time to report issues and contributed to this release—huge apologies if I overlooked anyone! They include Paprikas, Vevusik, netprophet, segr, ncrossland, kp52, mithrandir, ottogal, marturion, noahlearner, devtrench, pbowyer, adamboota, tonatos, andchir, uxello, sottwell, everettg_99, david55, multimedia, manu37, temus, breezer, eoler, and a-sharapov.<br />
